Usability: The app should be easy to use and navigate for anyone that is able to travel. It should be intuitive and helpful for any user. The selling point of the app is that it makes traveling more manageable.

Reliability: If the app stores trip details, personal details, and other information remotely, it could be useful to also store that locally in case of a system failure.

Performance: The app should run smoothly on any Android devices. The graphics will not be overly taxing on any device.

Supportability: The accuracy and upkeep of the app should be a priority. Implementing new features and correcting bugs efficiently would keep users engaged. Additionally, especially since it is a travel app, it would be useful to have other language and currency options.

Implementation: The current scope of the app seems large enough to be a challenge but not too large to be impossible. Using a database, especially one that references third-party material, like travel information, may be very useful, but dubious to implement. The product must be an Android app written in Java.

Interface: The app could connect with third-party databases of places to eat and places to stay. It could also connect with the phone's wallet system for any payments the user makes through the app.

Legal: If we implement travel information from the internet, we may need to get permission to use it. Additionally, all users will need to accept the risks associated with interacting with people online. The users will also need to give personal information about themselves, which we must handle responsibly.
