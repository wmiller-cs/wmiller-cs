1. Our plan for the next iteration is to delve deeper into creating trips, adding participants, and managing expenses.
2. Our plan for the next iteration is to finish all aspects of trip management for an individual user (use cases: start-new-trip, view-current-trip, view-all-trips). We will create an expense class to aid the Trip class (each expense entry has a cost, a memo, a location, and a date/time stamp (in the future, also a user tag for when multiple people are on a trip)). The Trip class should contain a list of expenses, functions to add/remove expenses, functions to sort list by expense attributes. The User class should be able to handle multiple current trips, have the ability to view all trips as a list, and view individual trip details from the view all trips use case.
3. Our plan for the next iteration is to implement the account system, including authentication and view profile / edit profile, and create and implement the expense list, which we were unable to due to time constraints and most of our efforts being focused on creating a working base prototype.
